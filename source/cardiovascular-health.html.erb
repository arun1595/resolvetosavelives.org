<h1>Save 100 million lives from cardiovascular disease</h1>

<p class="intro">18 million people die from cardiovascular disease each year. A majority of these premature deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Proven, scalable solutions exist, but there has been little investment and little progress made so far.</p>

<h2>How to save 100 million lives</h2>
<p>Resolve to Save Lives aims to save 100 million lives from cardiovascular disease by focusing on three evidence-based interventions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Increase coverage of hypertension treatment to 70%</li>
<li>Reduce sodium consumption by 30%</li>
<li>Eliminate trans fat from the global food supply</li>
</ol>

        <p><!--High blood pressure kills more people than all infectious diseases combined.--> Yet, there are simple, proven, affordable solutions that can be done within existing healthcare systems &#8212; for as little as $1 per person each year.</p>

    <div class="column">
        <div class="image"><img src="/images/sodium-small.png" alt=""></div>
        <p><!--Eating too much salt causes more than 2 million deaths each year from high blood pressure.--> Limiting the amount of sodium in foods is possible, and can be done cheaply: about $0.40 per person.</p>

        <div class="image"><img src="/images/trans-fats-small.png" alt=""></div>
        <p><!--Artificial trans fat is a toxic chemical in the global food supply that is fully replaceable with healthier oils.--> Eliminating trans fat will save 17 million lives over the next three decades.</p>

<p>The world is in the midst of a momentous shift in its approach to healthcare. We now recognize that the number of people dying from chronic diseases far outnumbers deaths from infectious diseases. Providers and governments are shifting their focus from preventing infections to preventing cardiovascular disease, and Resolve to Save Lives is accelerating that shift.</p>

<h2>Change is possible</h2>

<p>In Mumbai, India, 80 people die from a heart attack every single day. In January, Anisha Jain died of a heart attack leaving behind her young family. She and her husband lived in a middle class home in a good neighborhood. He is an accountant at a law firm and she did yoga 3 days a week and taught children in her building. What's remarkable about her story is how unremarkable it is. Like so many others, Anisha was living her life, building her family, and died too soon from a preventable non-communicable disease.</p>

<p>No matter where we live, everyone knows a relative who has died from a heart attack or stroke. Cardiovascular disease is so common that many people assume that death from a heart attack or stroke is just an inevitable tragedy for many adults. But, it's not inevitable.</p>

<p>Resolve to Save Lives is focused on working with regions to help them get started. Smart investments in a few key areas will show results relatively quickly. Progress is possible.</p>

<h2>How we work </h2>
<p>We work closely with partners, governments and civil society to help countries improve the heart health of their citizens. We work directly with countries, or through our partners, to fund and develop customized cardiovascular disease prevention programs based on the most recent evidence-based practices.</p>
