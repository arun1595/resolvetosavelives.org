<h1>We are a public health accelerator with one mission: save lives</h1>

<p class="intro">Resolve to Save Lives helps governments and civil society implement scalable, proven strategies.</p>

<p>We are determined to prevent millions of deaths from cardiovascular disease and epidemics, with a focus on accelerating action through speed, simplicity, and scale in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<p>Resolve to Save Lives is an initiative of the global health non-profit organization <a href="http://www.vitalstrategies.org">Vital Strategies</a> and we received $225 million from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/">Bloomberg Philanthropies</a>, the <a href="http://czi.org">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2>We are funders <em>and</em> operators</h2>
<div class="image-float"><a href="#"><img src="/images/one-pager.jpg" alt=""> Download a 1-pager about Resolve to Save Lives</a></div>
<p>We provide catalytic funding to countries interested in improving epidemic preparedness or their citizens’ heart health. And, we also staff the world’s leading experts in cardiovascular health and epidemic preparedness, so that we can send them into the field to provide on-the-ground technical assistance.</p>

<h2>We operate in dozens of countries</h2>
<p>We work primarily through our partners’ country offices. Our implementing partners include the World Health Organization, World Bank, CDC Foundation, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, and Vital Strategies.</p>
